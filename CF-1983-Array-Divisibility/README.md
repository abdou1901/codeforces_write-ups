# Array Divisibility Solution

This repository contains a C solution for the "Array Divisibility" problem from Codeforces Contest 1983, Problem A (rating: 800). The problem can be accessed [here](https://codeforces.com/contest/1983/problem/A).

## Problem Summary

### Input Description
- The first line contains an integer `t`, the number of test cases.
- For each test case, the first line contains an integer `n`, the length of the array.

### Output Description
- For each test case, output a single line containing `n` integers, representing an array that satisfies the divisibility condition mentioned in the problem statement.

## Approach and Rationale

The problem requires generating an array of length `n` such that the array satisfies certain divisibility conditions. However, the key observation is that any array of consecutive integers from 1 to `n` will trivially satisfy the condition stated in the problem due to the properties of consecutive integers and their sums.

### Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Read the number of test cases**: Use `scanf` to read the integer `t`.
2. **Process each test case**: For each test case, read the integer `n`.
3. **Generate the array**: Print the integers from 1 to `n` in a single line.
4. **Move to the next test case**: Use a loop to handle all test cases.

Since consecutive integers from 1 to `n` always satisfy the condition, this approach is both simple and efficient.

## Time and Space Complexity

### Time Complexity
- **Reading Input**: `O(t)` for reading the number of test cases.
- **Processing Each Test Case**: `O(n)` for each test case, where `n` is the length of the array.
- **Overall**: `O(t * n)`, which is efficient for the constraints given.

### Space Complexity
- **Auxiliary Space**: `O(1)` since we are not using any extra space that scales with the input size.

## Key Test Cases

### Sample Test Case
- **Input**:
  ```
  1
  5
  ```
- **Output**:
  ```
  1 2 3 4 5
  ```

### Edge Cases
- **Single Element Array**: When `n = 1`, the output should be `1`.
- **Max Length Array**: When `n` is the maximum possible value (e.g., `10^5`), the code should handle it without timing out.

## Extra Insights or Gotchas

1. **Efficiency**: The solution is highly efficient with `O(t * n)` time complexity, making it suitable for large inputs.
2. **Simplicity**: The use of consecutive integers simplifies the problem significantly, avoiding complex mathematical considerations.

This solution is a straightforward implementation that leverages the properties of consecutive integers to satisfy the problem's requirements efficiently.
